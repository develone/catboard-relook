. | Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that     |
. | nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long     |
. | endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have   |
. | come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting      |
. | place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might  |

. | who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power |
. | to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember  |
. | what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It  |
. | is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the         |
. | unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly |
. | advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great   |
. | task remaining before us-that from these honored dead we take     |
. | increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last     |
. | full measure of devotion-that we here highly resolve that these   |
. | dead shall not have died in vain-that this nation, under God,     |
. | shall have a new birth of freedom-and that government of the      |
. | people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the  |
